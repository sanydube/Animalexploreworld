title: "Dog Begs Them To Look At Her Heart And To Not Afraid Of Her Appearance
"
excerpt: "Can puppies be born with physical flaws and limitations that make them unpopular and even cause fear and rejection? Let’s be honest, who can blame these cute animals for being born with a problem? Is this why they don’t deserve as much respect and love, or do they not deserve a good life? It’s terrible that how people look has such a big effect on how they feel about them. This also goes for animals.

As in the case of a dog, whose appearance might make you dislike it. Its twisted face hides a lot of beautiful feelings. I wish there were no biases and that everyone learned to love and appreciate everyone, no matter what their background is. But people who are different from the norm because they don’t follow the rules are often rejected in the most unfair way. Everyone who sees her runs away and doesn’t give her a chance.
